# ðŸ“ŒProject for Cancer Patients


â–ªIn this project, we delved into a dataset encapsulating various health metric from cancer patients. 

The dataset consists of training dataset was 1514 rows & 16340 columns which involving 16340 
features and 1514 samples.

â–ªHere, the feature and sample ratio was significantly high, and 
overfitting was probable. Hence, feature selection was preferable to achieve a reliable ML 
model.

â–ªMoreover, there are three unique values including â€˜breast invasive carcinomaâ€™, â€˜lung 
squamous cell carcinomaâ€™ and, â€˜lung adenocarcinomaâ€™ in the primary disease.
